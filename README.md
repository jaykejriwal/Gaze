# Relationship between Entrainment and Gaze
Python program for understanding the relationship between gaze and entrainment at different linguistic levels.

## Dataset
We used the Gaze Aversion corpus to study and extract lexical, syntactic, semantic, and acoustic-prosodic features in an HRI corpus. 

The dataset is available upon request by mailing it to the original creators of the dataset
